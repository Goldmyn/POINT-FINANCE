# POINT-FINANCE

Point finance is a liquidity pool. A liquidity provider by definition is a market broker or
                  institution which behaves as a market maker in a chosen asset class. What does it mean? The
                  liquidity provider acts at both ends of currency transactions. He sells and buys a particular
                  asset at certain prices. It means that he is making the market.
